## Overview

Materialize and consume one effective row mask containing all pre-existing
unavailable rows plus owner-approved manual rows. Bind it to exact inputs and
fail closed at both ACF data-loading paths.

**Goal:** No Zach CHIME/FRB ACF can run without a verified effective mask, and
the mask excludes exactly the union of its two authoritative components.

## Current State Analysis

- `scripts/manual_bad_channels.py:34-104` validates and applies only manual rows.
- `pipeline/scintillation/scint_analysis/freya_scintillation.py:660-669` reaches
  automatic masking without a manual authority.
- `pipeline/scintillation/scint_analysis/pipeline.py:124-170` has the same gap.

## Desired End State

- A deterministic `.npy` mask and JSON provenance record are produced only
  from an owner-approved map whose source-valid hash matches.
- The materializer proves `effective == (~source_valid | manual)` exactly.
- Both ACF loaders verify hashes, frequency values, event, instrument, and
  approval before broadcasting the row mask.
- An authoritative artifact bypasses legacy statistical channel-row promotion;
  source masks and later non-finite/bandpass-validity masks remain active.
- Zach CHIME/FRB requires the artifact; the owner-approved artifact was wired
  on 2026-07-22 after this implementation plan completed.

## What We're NOT Doing

- Approving or changing the current Zach draft.
- Promoting automated RFI candidates into science support.
- Computing or accepting a new ACF result.
- Interpolating, replacing, or altering retained values.

## Implementation Approach

Use a versioned JSON provenance record beside a standard Boolean `.npy` mask.
The whole-file SHA-256 values are configured at consumption. A canonical digest
of the frequency values protects row alignment across different container
paths. Exact Boolean set equality is the correctness criterion; no numerical
tolerance or regression baseline is involved.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Materialize the exact union

- [x] Add tests in `tests/test_manual_bad_channels.py` proving the analytic set
  union, no extra rows, source-valid hash rejection, and draft rejection.
- [x] Run
  `/Users/jakobfaber/.conda/envs/py312/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_manual_bad_channels.py -q`
  and observe failure on the absent materializer.
- [x] Add `effective_bad_row_mask()` and artifact/provenance writing to
  `scripts/manual_bad_channels.py`; add `--source-valid`, `--output-mask`, and
  `--output-provenance`.
- [x] Re-run the focused test and require pass.

### Phase 2: Enforce the artifact at ACF boundaries

- [x] Add `scintillation/scint_analysis/tests/test_bad_channel_mask.py` proving
  exact masking, retained-value preservation, and rejection of missing,
  altered, misaligned, wrong-event, or unapproved artifacts.
- [x] Run the focused pipeline test and observe import failure.
- [x] Add `scintillation/scint_analysis/bad_channel_mask.py`, call it before
  regularization/downsampling from `freya_scintillation.py` and `pipeline.py`,
  bypass automatic row promotion when authoritative, and set the Zach CHIME
  config to `required: true, authoritative: true`.
- [x] Re-run focused pipeline tests and require pass.

### Phase 3: Validate and reproduce

- [x] Demonstrate each new correctness test fails under a deliberate local
  mutation, then restore it.
- [x] Run both focused suites and the existing ACF/config suites.
- [x] Repeat the focused suites in a fresh temporary virtual environment using
  the repository dependency specification.
- [x] Write implementation and validation records with exact commands.

## Success Criteria

### Automated Verification

- [x] Parent focused tests pass.
- [x] Pipeline focused and affected ACF tests pass.
- [x] Zach CHIME preparation fails with a clear missing-artifact error while
  the map remains draft.
- [x] Deliberately removing one source-invalid row from the union makes the
  invariant test fail.

### Manual Verification

- [x] Owner approval of the five Zach ranges was recorded on 2026-07-22 against
  the regenerated before/after review.

### Reproducibility & Correctness

- [x] Criterion: exact Boolean equality to the analytic union; no tolerance.
- [x] Inputs and outputs carry file hashes and a canonical frequency digest.
- [x] Minimal clean-environment reproduction passes.

## Testing Strategy

Small synthetic Boolean arrays provide a complete analytic reference. File
tampering and metadata mismatches exercise fail-closed behavior. Existing ACF
tests check integration regressions.

## Migration Strategy

Zach CHIME is activated with its owner-approved artifact and exact hashes.
Other events opt in as their maps are reviewed.

## Risk Assessment

- Mask applied after downsampling: high impact; prevented by applying at load.
- Wrong-event reuse: high impact; prevented by event/instrument checks.
- Draft science use: high impact; prevented at materialization and consumption.

## Edge Cases and Error Handling

Missing files, wrong dtype/shape, altered hashes, frequency reversal/drift,
wrong event/instrument, unapproved status, and empty manual selections all have
explicit behavior. An empty manual selection is valid only after owner approval;
source-unavailable rows still remain masked.

## Performance Considerations

One Boolean row mask is loaded once per preparation; cost is negligible beside
dynamic-spectrum loading.

## Documentation Updates

- [x] Update the manual-map README with materialization and ACF use.
