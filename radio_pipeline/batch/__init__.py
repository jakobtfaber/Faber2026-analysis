"""
FLITS Batch Processing Module
=============================

Provides infrastructure for running analysis pipelines across multiple FRBs
and aggregating results for comparative analysis.

Components:
- config_generator: Auto-generate configs from data file naming conventions
- batch_runner: Orchestrate multi-burst analysis with parallel execution
- results_db: Structured storage for analysis results
- joint_analysis: Cross-validate scattering and scintillation measurements
