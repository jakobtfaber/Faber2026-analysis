"""
Bridge module that exposes the legacy `scattering` code under the
installable `radio_pipeline.scattering` namespace.

This lets downstream code use standard imports such as
`from radio_pipeline.scattering.scat_analysis import burstfit` without relying on
ad-hoc `sys.path` manipulation.

Also exports broadening utilities from `.broaden`.
