# Reproducing the figures and tables in Faber2026

This maps every manuscript output — each `*_table.tex` and each `figures/…`
graphic — back to the command that regenerates it. It is the reproducibility
spine for the ApJ Data Availability statement.

The machine-readable version is [`repro_manifest.csv`](repro_manifest.csv)
(one row per output). This file is the prose companion: how to read it, how the
two repos relate, and the caveats that a CSV cell can't carry.

## The two-repository structure (read this first)

Faber2026 is **not** a monolith. `pipeline/` is a **git submodule** pointing at
`https://github.com/dsa110/dsa110-FLITS.git` — a separate repository with
its own history, remote, and lifecycle. Outputs therefore fall into two classes:

- **Faber2026-local producers** live under `scripts/` in this repo. Edit and
  run them here.
- **Submodule producers** live under `pipeline/…` (i.e. inside dsa110-FLITS).
  Changing them is a commit to the *shared library*, not to the manuscript.
  Treat those edits with library-grade caution (other consumers inherit them).

The `run_command` column reflects this: `scripts/…` producers run from the repo
root; `pipeline/…` producers run from inside `pipeline/` under the submodule's
own environment.

One wrinkle worth knowing before you go looking for a pipeline commit. The
`.gitmodules` URL above is what a fresh `git submodule update --init` clones,
and it resolves the pinned SHA. **Pipeline development happens on the
`jakobtfaber/dsa110-FLITS` fork.** Since FLITS #151 merged the old divergent
line (`fix/budget-table-data-post-igm-lognormal`) into the fork's `main`, the
pin base is an ancestor of fork `main`; the pin itself sits 1–2 replayed
commits off it. The full pin lineage is published on the fork branch
**`pin/faber2026`** (since 2026-07-09), so pinned SHAs are reachable by ref,
not just as fork-network dangling objects. A pipeline fix is PR'd against fork
`main`, then replayed onto the pin (see FLITS #149 → Faber2026 #71, and
FLITS #156 → the guards pin bump, for the pattern); advance `pin/faber2026` on
every bump, and check `git merge-base --is-ancestor` before ever bumping the
pin.

## Environment

There are **two** environments, and which one you need depends on where the
producer lives.

**Submodule producers (`pipeline/…`)** use the `uv` lock
(`pipeline/uv.lock`, `requires-python >=3.12`), invoked from within `pipeline/`:

```bash
cd pipeline
uv sync            # once, materializes the locked environment
uv run python <producer.py> [args]
```

**Faber2026-local producers (`scripts/…`)** have no lockfile of their own, and
bare `python` is not a defined interpreter for them — on a clean shell it is
simply `command not found`. They run under the conda env named **`flits`**,
whose spec is `pipeline/environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f pipeline/environment.yml   # once; creates `flits`
conda run -n flits python scripts/<producer.py> [args]
```

`flits` is required rather than merely convenient: `plot_ne2025_mw_properties.py`
imports `healpy`, which is in `pipeline/environment.yml` but **not** in
`pipeline/uv.lock`. The older campaign scripts under
`analysis/scattering-refit-2026-06/` were also authored against `flits` and say
so in their docstrings. Prefer `uv run` where the script is `uv`-clean; every
row's `run_command` names the environment it actually needs.

## How to read `clone_verified`

`writer_verified` is a **reading** standard — someone read the `savefig` line.
`clone_verified` is an **execution** standard: on 2026-07-09 every distinct
`run_command` was executed from a fresh `git clone` + `git submodule update
--init` at super-repo `733a369` × pipeline `6c87890`. The two disagree often
enough that the DA statement should rest on the second.

"Executed" here means more than *exit 0*. For each command a marker file is
touched immediately before the run, and the verdict asks which files anywhere
under the clone are newer than that marker. The first pass of this audit instead
compared each output's mtime against `README.md`'s — but `git clone` writes every
file within the same second, so that comparison reported "written" for outputs no
producer had touched. It scored three rows `reproduced` whose producers write
somewhere else entirely. **A generator that exits 0 while writing nothing at the
declared path is the single most common failure here**, and it is invisible to
both a `savefig` read and a return code.

- **reproduced** — the command as written exits 0 and writes the declared
  output into the clone.
- **reproduced_fixed_cmd** — the command *as previously written* did not work;
  the corrected command now in the `run_command` cell was executed and does.
- **wrong_output_path** — the command exits 0 but does not write the declared
  output at the declared path. Exit status alone would have hidden this.
- **blocked_external_data** — the producer needs inputs that exist in neither
  repository (an HPC scratch tree, or a data directory with zero tracked
  files). Not reproducible from a clone by anyone, including the author on a
  fresh machine.
- **no_command** — nothing runnable is recorded.

Result: of the manifest's 26 rows, **12 regenerate from a fresh clone** (5 as
written, 7 only after correcting the command), **4 exit 0 while writing nothing
at the declared path**, 8 are blocked on data outside both repos, and 2 have no
command. (The 2026-07-09 execution sweep ran the 25 rows then present; the
As of 2026-07-11 the embedded Fig. 1 sequence is `figures/codetection_triptych/*_triptych.pdf` (`scripts/plot_codetection_triptych.py`); the compact gallery remains a diagnostic-only product. The earlier 26th, `figures/codetection_gallery.pdf`, was added the same day with its
verdict assigned by inspection rather than execution — its inputs are the 24
`~/Data/Faber2026/dsa110/DSA_bursts/*_cntr_bpc.npy` products, which exist in
neither repo, so it is `blocked_external_data` without needing a run.)

9 of the 10 rows marked `embedded_in_manuscript = yes` regenerate — **5 of
those 9 needed their `run_command` corrected first**, so the pre-audit manifest
could not have rebuilt the manuscript. The tenth, `codetection_gallery.pdf`,
is the first row that is *both* embedded and blocked: the committed manuscript
now includes one figure that cannot be rebuilt from a fresh clone until the
burst waterfall products are deposited (see hazard 6). Every other blocked or
command-less row is a *staged* output waiting on a result SLOT; those cannot
be promoted into the manuscript until their inputs are published alongside the
code.

⚠️ **This is a statement about the manifest, not about the manuscript.** The
manifest does not enumerate every embedded output — see hazard 7. Until it does,
"all embedded outputs reproduce" is *not* a claim the Data Availability statement
can make.

## How to read `writer_verified`

- **yes** — I read the actual `write_text` / `fig.savefig(...)` line that emits
  this exact filename. The command is trustworthy.
- **candidate** — the producing *module or function* is identified, but I did
  not confirm a single trustworthy command for this exact stem. Two sub-cases:
  (a) the file is emitted by a multi-figure script (e.g. `systems_figures.py`,
  `scint_census/figbank.py`, `crossmatching/plotting.py`) where I did not
  isolate the one savefig call for this stem — the command regenerates the
  figure *set*; or (b) the producing function is confirmed but no committed CLI
  caller passes this stem (e.g. `freya_dsa_gamma_summary`). Confirm the
  individual target before relying on it in the DA statement.
- **unresolved** — no producer found anywhere in the current tree.

(The **hand** status used in earlier versions is now retired: the two
hand-maintained tables were converted to generated emitters — see the table
regeneration section below.)

## Status: what's embedded now vs. staged

The manuscript is mid-draft. Of 26 tracked outputs (22 figures + 4 tables),
ten are currently `\input`/`\includegraphics`'d (the
`embedded_in_manuscript = yes` rows — most recently
`figures/codetection_gallery.pdf`, the unified 12-burst dynamic-spectra
gallery added 2026-07-09); the other 16 (fifteen figures + the
staged `beta_table.tex`) are produced and sit in the repo but are not yet
placed — they are waiting on the abstract's bracketed result SLOTs (joint
two-band scattering, scintillation attribution, band-restricted energies). One
of the staged figures, `ne2025_mw_characterization.pdf`, is a true orphan: it
is the default-resolution (`--nside 8`) sibling of the embedded `_nside32`
variant and is not referenced anywhere. Both classes are tracked so nothing is
lost when a SLOT is filled.

## Regenerating the tables

Three of the four tables are generated from a data file + an emitter; edit the
**data file**, never the `.tex`. Each root `.tex` also carries a
`% !! GENERATED FILE` banner with its own regenerate line.

Both are safe to regenerate at the currently pinned submodule (`14e0d1f`);
regenerating reproduces the committed `.tex` byte-for-byte. This was briefly
untrue — see hazard 1 for what went wrong and why the pin matters. (The pin
reached `14e0d1f` in three steps: `6c87890 → 334cc74` as Faber2026 #68, then
`334cc74 → 79eaf7e` as Faber2026 #71, a single commit promoting the `zach`
C2D4 beta fit, then `79eaf7e → 14e0d1f` as the guards pin-bump PR, a single
commit promoting the CHIME artifact-control guards (FLITS #156; scintillation
lane only). Across the whole `6c87890 → 14e0d1f` range no `*_table_data.json`
and neither table emitter is touched, so the byte-exact regeneration of
`budget_table.tex` and `foreground_table.tex` is unchanged from the earlier
verification. `beta_table.tex` is a separate matter — see the note below.)

`#71` did change the submodule's `analysis/beta_campaign/beta_table_rows.tex`
(the `zach` row moved from `_C1D1` to `_C2D4_cwin`). The root `beta_table.tex`
is hand-maintained, is not `\input` by the manuscript, and is deliberately left
untouched: `tab:beta` is deferred. Do not treat that file as regenerable-and-current.

```bash
cd pipeline
# budget table: values in galaxies/foreground/budget_table_data.json
uv run python -m galaxies.foreground.budget_table_emitter     --out ../budget_table.tex
# foreground census: values in galaxies/foreground/foreground_table_data.json
uv run python -m galaxies.foreground.foreground_table_emitter --out ../foreground_table.tex
# verify (byte-exact vs exports/ + value cross-checks against upstream products)
uv run pytest galaxies/foreground/test_budget_table_emitter.py \
              galaxies/foreground/test_foreground_table_emitter.py
# ^ green at pipeline pin 6c87890 (verified 2026-07-09).
```

Each emitter also writes a canonical copy to `pipeline/exports/<table>.tex` (the
byte-exact regression anchor) and supports `--check` (non-zero exit on drift).
**`--check` is not a sufficient CI gate on its own** — it compares the emitter's
output to `exports/<table>.tex`, and both are derived from the *same*
submodule-local data file, so it cannot see the cross-repository drift of
hazard 1. Measured at pin `f9e1c24`: both emitters' `--check` exited 0 while
`test_dm_host_matches_forward_model` failed. (That test's row loop uses a bare
`assert`, so one run reports only the first mismatching sightline —
FRB 20220207C; replaying the comparison without short-circuiting shows all nine
differed.) CI must run the **parity tests**, not just `--check`.
The `\input{budget_table}` /
`\input{foreground_table}` paths
in `sections/` are unchanged: the emitters overwrite the manuscript's root
`.tex` files in place, so the Overleaf lane (which has no `pipeline/` submodule)
keeps building. `sample_table.tex` uses its own generator
(`scripts/make_sample_table.py`); `beta_table.tex` uses
`analysis/beta_campaign/export_beta_table.py`.

The parity tests are the substantive guarantee — they tie each table to a
*recomputable* upstream product, not just to its own export. They have already
earned their keep once: they are what caught the drift described in hazard 1.
- **budget** — the DM_host `median^{+p84}_{-p16}` column is cross-checked
  value-for-value against the forward-model posteriors in
  `scripts/dm_budget_uncertainty.csv` (emitted by `scripts/dm_budget_uncertainty.py`),
  over the 9 non-placeholder sightlines. Green at pin `6c87890` (9/9), verified
  2026-07-09. Note the test spans **both repositories**: it reads a super-repo
  CSV from a submodule test, so it is only meaningful for a matched
  (super-repo commit, submodule pin) pair.
- **foreground** — every numeric object ID's verdict is cross-checked against
  the census registry `pipeline/galaxies/foreground/data/intervening_census_registry.csv`
  (27/27 registry-resident rows). The table is a curated subset of the registry's
  confirmed+inconclusive systems (refuted candidates omitted; the cluster row's
  ID comes from the WenHan2024 catalog, not the registry).

## Caveats and hazards (the things worth fixing)

1. **The budget-table parity test spans two repositories, so the submodule pin
   is part of the result. (RESOLVED 2026-07-09 by PRs #48 and #53 — recorded as
   a standing trap.)**

   `test_dm_host_matches_forward_model` lives in the submodule but reads
   `scripts/dm_budget_uncertainty.csv` from the **super-repo**. Its verdict is
   therefore a property of the *pair* (super-repo commit, `pipeline` pin), not
   of either repo alone. That let a drift open up silently:

   - **PR #40** re-based the cosmic DM term on the TNG-calibrated IGM log-normal
     (Connor 2025), rewriting `dm_budget_uncertainty.csv`.
   - **PR #42** further corrected the low-z IGM spline.
   - `budget_table.tex` was updated to follow. `budget_table_data.json`, in the
     submodule, was not — and the pin stayed at `f9e1c24`.

   For a window on 2026-07-09 the emitter was therefore *behind* the manuscript:
   at pin `f9e1c24` all 9 non-placeholder sightlines mismatched, and running the
   documented regenerate command would have rewritten 35 lines of
   `budget_table.tex`, reverting the DM_host column to pre-#40 values. The
   `% !! GENERATED FILE -- do not edit by hand` banner pointed exactly the wrong
   way: for that window, the hand edits were the correct ones.

   Note what did *not* fire: throughout that window both emitters' `--check`
   exited 0, because the emitter and its `exports/` anchor were regenerated from
   the same stale `budget_table_data.json`. A drift guard that compares a
   generator to its own output is blind by construction to an upstream input
   going stale. Only the parity test, which reaches across into the super-repo's
   CSV, could see it.

   **PRs #48 and #53 closed it** by bumping the pin to a commit that carries a
   regenerated `budget_table_data.json`. Verified at pin `6c87890`: the parity
   test is 9/9 green, `--check` exits 0, and the emitter's output is
   byte-identical to the committed `budget_table.tex`. This still holds at the
   current pin `79eaf7e` (Faber2026 #68 then #71): the `6c87890 → 79eaf7e` range
   does not touch `budget_table_data.json` or either table emitter, so the 9/9
   parity result carries over unchanged. The `parity` CI job re-ran the emitters
   against the super-repo at each pin bump and was green on both.

   Closing it took two tries, and the misfire is the more useful half of the
   story. **`f9e1c24` — the pin this repo had carried since #39 — is not an
   ancestor of `dsa110-FLITS` `main`.** It sits on `agent/sightline-halo-grid-figure`,
   22 commits divergent since the fork at `6647753`, and the budget-table emitter
   exists *only* on that line; `main` has never carried it. #48 bumped to
   `c69d043`, a squash produced by merging the pin's branch into FLITS `main` —
   which silently dragged the whole 127-file fork delta upstream, rolled back an
   unrelated `johndoeII` promotion, and turned FLITS CI red. FLITS #145 reverted
   it; #53 re-pinned here to `6c87890` = `f9e1c24` + the three intended files.

   Second lesson, then: **before bumping the pin, check that the new commit is a
   descendant of the old one** (`git merge-base --is-ancestor <old> <new>`).
   A submodule pin that lives off the upstream default branch — as this one does —
   makes "just merge it upstream" the wrong reflex.

   The lesson worth keeping: **a green parity test in the submodule proves
   nothing until the super-repo pins the commit that made it green.** When you
   change `dm_budget_uncertainty.py` / `.csv`, regenerate
   `budget_table_data.json` in `dsa110-FLITS` and bump the gitlink in the same
   breath, or the next person to run the "safe" regenerate command silently
   reverts your numbers.

   (Two sightlines — FRB 20220310F and FRB 20221203A, both $z\approx0.5$ — carry
   *negative* DM_host medians. This is intended, not a defect: their posteriors
   are consistent with zero, `P(DM_host<0)≈0.5`, and `budget_table.tex`'s own
   `\tablecomments` explains that the marginally negative medians reflect scatter
   about the cosmological normalization. Do not "fix" them by censoring at zero.)

2. **The two hand-maintained tables are now generated. (RESOLVED 2026-07-08,
   with the caveat in hazard 1.)**
   Both `budget_table.tex` and `foreground_table.tex` — previously the least
   reproducible objects in the manuscript — are now emitted from structured
   single-source data files with parity tests. See *Regenerating the tables*
   below. What used to be the hazard, for the record:
   - `budget_table.tex` had a "regenerate, not by hand" header but was in fact
     a hand transcription; a DR8/DR9 drift had already slipped through
     (`language_audit.md`).
   - `foreground_table.tex`'s own header stated no generator existed.

   Now each `.tex` carries a `% !! GENERATED FILE` banner naming its data source
   and regenerate command, and a hand edit that drifts from the source data is
   caught by the parity tests. `budget_table.tex`'s measured `tau_obs` column is
   still withheld pending the V1 re-validation ladder (a data-content decision,
   independent of the emitter).

3. **`plot_association_cards.py` machine-specific output path. (RESOLVED 2026-07-08.)**
   `MANUSCRIPT_OUTDIR` was `/Users/jakobfaber/Developer/overleaf/Faber2026/figures/association_cards`
   (`b19a3d3`) — worked on one laptop only. `ae67f4f` replaced it with a
   **repo-relative default derived from the file location**
   (`ROOT.parent/figures/association_cards`), overridable with
   `--manuscript-dir`; `--no-manuscript-copy` skips the copy entirely for a
   standalone submodule checkout. No absolute machine path remains *in this
   script*; it survives a clone to any location.

   (An earlier revision of this file said the constant passed through a
   "repo-absolute path" on its way to repo-relative. It did not: no version of
   `plot_association_cards.py` in any ref of `dsa110-FLITS` ever held a
   `/Users/jakobfaber/Developer/repos/...` literal. The fix went from the
   Overleaf absolute path straight to `ROOT.parent`. Corrected 2026-07-09 —
   and note that the fix was never carried across to the two `galaxies/v2_0/`
   modules that share the same defect. See hazard 5.)

4. **Producer resolution for the two burst-nickname figures:**
   - `freya_dsa_gamma_summary.pdf` (freya = FRB 20230325A) — **resolved** to the
     producing function `plot_subband_gamma_summary` in
     `scintillation/scint_analysis/plotting.py`, confirmed by commit `18fbe98`
     ("freya DSA gamma(nu) summary — manuscript export", FLITS #130, run at
     pinned submodule `25b8cc6` against `scintillation/configs/bursts/freya_dsa.yaml`
     Lorentzian fits). The function takes a caller-supplied `save_path` and no
     committed CLI script passes the `freya_dsa_gamma_summary` stem, so it is
     `candidate`, not `yes` — the author should confirm/commit the driver.
   - `whitney_multiplicity.pdf` (whitney = FRB 20220310F) — **unresolved.** It
     was committed as a binary copy-in (commit `438825f`), not by any script in
     the tree. Commit `b96aa29` frames it as whitney's 1-component multiplicity
     demo (α rails to 1.5 under the [1.5, 6.0] prior; whitney stays 2-component
     canonical at α≈5.1). Almost certainly a local/HPC `burstfit` run that was
     never committed. Needs author confirmation.

5. **Two `galaxies/v2_0/` modules defaulted their output to a hardcoded personal
   Overleaf path — and one of them was not saved by its `run_command`. FIXED at
   the current pin. (Code fix landed as FLITS #148, first reaching this repo at
   pin `334cc74` via the `6c87890 → 334cc74` bump, Faber2026 #68. The current
   pin `79eaf7e` — Faber2026 #71 — is a descendant of `334cc74` and carries the
   fix unchanged.)**

   Hazard 3 fixed `plot_association_cards.py`. It did not fix its neighbours:

   - `galaxies/v2_0/sightline_halo_grid.py:59`
   - `galaxies/v2_0/systems_figures.py:76`

   both set `DEFAULT_OUT_DIR = "/Users/jakobfaber/Developer/overleaf/Faber2026/figures"`.
   `sightline_halo_grid.py` is harmless *only* because its `run_command` passes
   `--out-dir ../figures` explicitly. `systems_figures.py`'s command did not, so
   running it as documented exits **0** while writing `clusters_icm.*` and
   `galaxies_cgm.*` into a directory that exists on exactly one laptop — silently
   outside the repository, and on any other machine into a freshly `makedirs`'d
   path nobody will look in. This was found on 2026-07-09 by executing the
   command and then noticing the six modified files in the *Overleaf* checkout
   (restored). **FLITS PR #148** replaced both defaults with
   `os.path.join(os.path.dirname(_REPO), "figures")` — the same `_REPO`-derived
   form hazard 3 used — and that fix is now in the pinned submodule (present
   since `334cc74`, verified again at the current pin `79eaf7e`:
   `DEFAULT_OUT_DIR` is repo-derived at
   `sightline_halo_grid.py:63` and `systems_figures.py:80`). A bare run therefore
   lands `clusters_icm.*` / `galaxies_cgm.*` inside the repository. The manifest's
   `run_command` still passes `--out-dir ../figures` explicitly, so the documented
   invocation was already safe and remains so. The undeclared ordering dependency
   below is unaffected by #148 and still stands.

   The same run exposed an **undeclared ordering dependency**: `systems_figures.py`
   reads `pipeline/results/sightline_dm_scattering_budget.csv`, which nothing in
   the manifest produced before it. That CSV comes from `sightline_budget`, which
   in turn only runs in **module** form — as a script its direct-execution import
   fallback (`galaxies/foreground/sightline_budget.py:61-65`) imports
   `MASS_PRIORITY` but drops `build_unified_records`, so line 494 raises
   `NameError`. Both are fixed in the manifest's commands and neither was
   detectable by reading a `savefig` line.

6. **Seven staged figures are not reproducible from a clone by anyone.**
   `chime_subband_compare.py`, `joint_ladder/_subband_tau_validation.py` and
   `plot_jointmodel_montage.py` read from `/central/scratch/jfaber/flits-runs/…`,
   an HPC scratch tree; `scint_census/figbank.py` reads
   `scint_census/data/scint/…`, a directory with **zero tracked files**. All seven
   are `embedded_in_manuscript = no`. Any of them that later enters the
   manuscript must have its inputs published — a committed data file, or a
   deposited archive — before the DA statement can cover it.

   **2026-07-09 update: this class now has its first embedded member.**
   `figures/codetection_gallery.pdf` (fig:codetection-gallery, row 26) reads
   the 24 `~/Data/Faber2026/dsa110/DSA_bursts/*_cntr_bpc.npy` waterfall
   products and is `embedded_in_manuscript = yes` while `blocked_external_data`
   — the deposition requirement above is no longer hypothetical. The burst
   waterfall products (or a subset sufficient to re-render the gallery) must be
   part of the data release before the DA statement can cover this figure.

7. **The manifest does not enumerate every embedded output. (OPEN — this is the
   weakest link in the DA statement.)**

   `repro_manifest.csv` is treated as the authoritative list of manuscript
   outputs, but the built manuscript `\includegraphics` two families for which it
   has **no rows at all**:

   - `figures/dsa_lorentzian_summary.pdf` — `sections/results.tex:157`
   - `figures/dsa_scint_acf/*_dsa_acf_lorentzian_fits.pdf` — 12 committed panels,
     pulled in via `sections/appendix.tex:193` → `sections/dsa_scint_acf.tex`

   That is **13 embedded files with zero reproducibility evidence.** A producer
   does exist in the submodule —
   `pipeline/analysis/scintillation-dsa-lorentzian-2026-07-07/run_dsa_lorentzian_fits.py`
   — but it has never been given a manifest row, a `run_command`, or a
   `clone_verified` verdict, and this audit did **not** execute it.

   The consequence is worse than a gap: because the manifest defines the set it
   audits, a green sweep over its 26 rows reads as "the manuscript reproduces"
   while silently skipping the scintillation figures. Any future coverage check
   must derive the output set from the manuscript's `\includegraphics` and
   `\input` directives, not from the manifest's own row list. Until these rows
   exist and are executed, the DA statement can claim only that *the outputs the
   manifest tracks* regenerate.

## Suggested next steps

- **Close hazard 7 first.** Add rows for `dsa_lorentzian_summary.pdf` and the 12
  `dsa_scint_acf/` panels, run their producer from a fresh clone, and record a
  `clone_verified` verdict. Nothing else in this file matters to the DA statement
  as much as this.
- Deposit the `DSA_bursts` `_cntr_bpc.npy` products (or a gallery-sufficient
  subset): `figures/codetection_gallery.pdf` is now the only embedded row the
  DA statement cannot cover, and data deposition is the only way to close it.
- Fill the two unresolved producers (author knowledge) and promote their rows
  to `writer_verified = yes`.
- Hazards (1) and (2) are both **done**: the two tables are generated + tested,
  and `plot_association_cards.py`'s output path is now a repo-relative default
  with `--manuscript-dir` / `--no-manuscript-copy` overrides.
- **Hazard (5) is partly closed; (6) is open.** (5)'s `DEFAULT_OUT_DIR` half is
  **done** — FLITS #148 made it repo-relative in the two `galaxies/v2_0/` modules,
  in the pinned submodule since `334cc74` (Faber2026 #68) and still present at the
  current pin `79eaf7e` (Faber2026 #71). Still open in (5): add
  the missing `build_unified_records` to `sightline_budget.py`'s fallback import
  (confirmed still absent at `79eaf7e` — neither #148 nor #71 touches
  `sightline_budget.py`). (6) is a data-deposition decision,
  not a code fix.
- Once producers are confirmed, this manifest can back a top-level `Makefile`
  target (`make figures`) that regenerates the embedded set end-to-end. The
  `clone_verified = reproduced*` rows are exactly the set that target can cover
  today.
